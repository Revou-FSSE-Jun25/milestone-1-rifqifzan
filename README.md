How to Use

To view and interact with this website:

    Clone the Repository (if applicable): If this website is hosted on a version control system like GitHub, clone the repository to your local machine:

    git clone <repository-url>

    Open index.html: Navigate to the root directory of the project and open the index.html file in your web browser. This will launch the website.

Navigation

    Use the navigation links in the header (Profile, Skill, Project, Contact) to jump to different sections of the website.

    On smaller screens, click the hamburger menu icon to expand or collapse the navigation links.

Contact Me

    Scroll down to the "Contact Me" section.

    Fill in your Name, Email, and Message in the respective fields.

    Click the "Send Message" button to submit your message. (Note: The current implementation has a placeholder onclick event that redirects to GitHub. For actual message sending, server-side logic would be required.)
